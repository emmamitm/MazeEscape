## Required Developer Software
Install the following:
1. C++
3. Visual Studio Code
2. GitHub
3. etc.

## Running Locally
After cloning the code locally from the main repo, follow these steps:
1. Run ```npm install```
2. In ***gitpro/app.js*** add your files for the repo
    1. add app.js and other folder files
    2. this is **important** make sure to commit and push
    3. type ```git status``` to see if they were added
3. Next step for running the porgram locally
4. what to do next
    1. ```git add .```
    2. ```git commit -m "initial commit"```
    3. ```git push```
- more markup
    - bullets if you need them

## Usage Information
This is a complex algorithm created to solve a maze problem. You type in a vector of strings into main vector<string> graph = {"s#.#.", ".#...", "...#t"}. The 's' is the start of the maze and the 't' is the end. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between s and t, noting that you can only move to '.' nodes and not '#' ones.
