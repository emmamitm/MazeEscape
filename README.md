Maze Escape written by Emma Mitchell

## Required Developer Software
Install the following:
1. C++

## Usage Information
This is a complex algorithm created to solve a maze problem. You type in a vector of strings into main vector<string> graph = {"s#.#.", ".#...", "...#t"}. The 's' is the start of the maze and the 't' is the end. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between s and t, noting that you can only move to '.' nodes and not '#' ones.
